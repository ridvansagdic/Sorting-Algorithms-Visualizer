# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This simple web application is created to visualize various sorting algorithms. Users can enter four numbers and then choose different sorting algorithms to observe how these numbers are sorted.

## Used Algorithms
The application supports the following sorting algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort:** Sorts the array by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

- **Selection Sort:** Selects the smallest (or largest) element at each step and places it in its appropriate position to sort the array.

- **Insertion Sort:** Takes one element at a time and places it in the correct position to sort the array.

## Usage
1. Enter the numbers to be sorted into the four input boxes in the upper right corner.
2. Choose a sorting algorithm from the "Choose Sorting Algorithm" menu.
3. Select the sorting order (ascending or descending) from the "Choose Sorting Format" menu.
4. Initiate the sorting process by clicking the "Sort Now" button.

## Visualization
The steps of each algorithm are displayed in a table with columns "Step," "Comparison," and "Array." By following the steps, you can observe each stage of the algorithm and understand how the sorting process unfolds.
